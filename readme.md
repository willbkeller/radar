phase 1:

    building a "coffee can" FMCW radar

    TO DO:
        1. Pick Frequency range
        
            a. need to be able to
            distinguish sUAS. probably
            north of 4 ghz. should aim for
            being able to detect a 4x4 or
            6x6 inch corner reflector at 
            100m
            
            b. need to weight RF band on 
            component availability and cost 
            for selected band

        2. Define architecture
        3. Select components 
        4. design PCB
        5. Manufacture PCB
        6. Code
        7. Post Processed data 
        8. Streamed live data into app

phase 1:

    building a "coffee can" FMCW radar front end for the ADALM pluto

    TO DO:
        1. Project Scope 
            Generate a front end RF board to attach to the standard ADALM-PLUTO SDR which functions as both signal generator and passthrough for Received RF signals in testing radar up to 3.8 GHz. Board will be complete with VCO, filter bank

            REV2 will contain no mixer architecture to combine both signals and include an additon TX passthrough and Power amplifiers for the TX ports available on the ADALM-PLUTO. 

            DSP techniques will be used to sample the RF signals received into the ADALM-pluto to capture radar returns from sUAS. 
            
        2. Define architecture
        3. Select components 
        4. design PCB
        5. Manufacture PCB
        6. Code
        7. Post Processed data 
        8. Streamed live data into app
